    <h1>From Angels to the Apocalypse</h1>
    <h3>Kyle Liao: Personal Essay</h3>
    <p>
      AngelHacks started on May 27th, 2023. Apocalypse started on May 17th,
      2024. In that one year, I‚Äôve attended over 10 hackathons. This is just a
      small piece of that story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before AngelHacks, I had one year of real programming experience, much
      less than most of you reading this. I knew how to build little things, and
      I was blessed with the opportunity to have worked with much better hackers
      than myself. That was enough to make me happy, but I wanted more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As many of you know, your first hackathon is nerve-racking. It‚Äôs a lot of
      new experiences, crammed tightly into one package. Although AngelHacks was
      not my first hackathon, it was the first time I would travel by myself,
      over 300 miles away, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I arrived at Penn Station to catch the bus to Boston in the middle of
      the night, I looked at the departure board and thought about hopping on
      the train home. I was scared for a lot of reasons, but truth be told, I
      questioned what the hell I was doing. No one expected me to go, and this
      was a time before Hack Club‚Äôs Gas Fund. This was my own money and my own
      volition, and to the organizers, I was a name on a list that was never
      going to show.
    </p>
    <i>Hey Yu Kang Kyle Liao!üëã</i>
    <p>
      It‚Äôs surprising how quickly things turn. How we are both masters of our
      fate and subject to chaos. I ended that event pacing through Cambridge,
      over the bridge into Back Bay, as a winner of sorts, walking through the
      city, admiring the people, the buildings, and the magic of it all. Two
      days before, I was filled with self-doubt, and in a mere weekend most
      spend between Netflix and bed, I became this kid who traveled across the
      Northeast, ordered breakfast at a 24-hour diner like a real backpacker,
      watched dogs in the dog park at 6 AM in a city not my own, confidently
      shook hands with strangers to make a team, got an Uber and lunch with
      strangers, and walked for hours just to adventure. And even though I am
      that person, I still felt like a fraud. Because, in my mind, this isn‚Äôt my
      life. I‚Äôm not some spontaneous, fearless, carefree individual. I swipe my
      ID card day-in and day-out at school. I sleep in the same bed every night.
      I‚Äôm not some magical do-it-all programmer. I yell at the computer and talk
      to myself, and my mind goes in circles. All I did in Boston was build a
      game about grass. But people would remember that, and I‚Äôd go on to do
      similar things again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after AngelHacks, Outernet was announced. I couldn‚Äôt be there
      since I‚Äôd be on the other side of the world, but it felt better knowing it
      was my own choice compared to Assemble, where I got a spot but just
      couldn‚Äôt stomach the cost of a last-minute ticket to San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I‚Äôd go on to more than make up for it. Sometimes, the chaos works
      against our dreams, but sometimes you have to laugh in its face. I decided
      to work harder on planning TeenHacksLI, to give New Yorkers back their OG
      high school hackathon, and kept searching for events to go to.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first I went to after AngelHacks was HackUMBC, which was
      absolutely wild. I built a really great project there, and it still makes
      me proud to this day. The city of Baltimore, a giant hurricane, a 3 AM nap
      on a train station bench, a super competitive crowd, and absolutely
      terrible food couldn‚Äôt stop us from having a blast working with a giant
      group of people building something useful just for us. We figured out how
      to turn RC cars into a hackathon hardware prototyping tool. The whole
      experience taught me that Baltimoreans have a grit that you can count on.
      Hackathons are unique in that aspect because they let you do more than
      visit; they enable you to work with people from a different culture.
    </p>
    <i>
      HackUMBC Shoutout: A UMBC-alumni teacher I see all the time brings his
      students to overnight hackathons. He‚Äôs my inspiration to fight bureaucracy
      for what‚Äôs right and to push the boundaries of education.
    </i>
    <p>
      After that was HackRPI, located in the beautiful Hudson River Valley. In
      NYC handball, my sport of choice, sometimes you play and end up not
      hitting the wall. Sometimes you go to a hackathon, don‚Äôt get the numbers
      of your teammates, and they disappear. Sometimes you work as hard as you
      can, and at the end, there isn‚Äôt anything solid left between your fingers.
      Sometimes you scream into a carpeted floor, burn a plastic chair with a
      soldering iron, and your neighbors look at you funny. That‚Äôs the way it is
      sometimes.
    </p>
    <i>
      HackRPI Shoutout: My friend Miles went to this hackathon with me and
      helped convince me, despite all of the untold and told hijinks, that I
      should go. He‚Äôs my inspiration to be a little more stubborn.
    </i>
    <p>
      Other times, you go batshit crazy, and it all works out. That‚Äôs exactly
      the vibe of ‚ÄúSix in a Row.‚Äù Imagine going to six hackathons in a row,
      basically spending every weekend traveling and hacking. You don‚Äôt have to
      after I finish writing that story, but for now, here‚Äôs the overview.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might be one of the few, or the first, who has traveled across the
      country, from high schools to colleges, from 12-hour events to 40-hour
      events, all in six weeks. Maybe a few too many conditional statements to
      be an accolade, but certainly unique. Remember TeenHacksLI? I started this
      journey by running that event. For a 12-hour hackathon, I made it feel a
      whole lot longer. I squeezed as much programming and demo time in as
      possible by pushing everything unnecessary online. I pushed my team to its
      limits to provide as many workshops and activities as possible to reach as
      many people as possible. But, even now, I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it.
      It‚Äôs one of my best pieces of work, but it didn‚Äôt live up to all of my
      dreams. I suppose only time will tell when those baby hackers and
      organizers fight their next battles, and we will see if my foundation
      holds.
    </p>
    <i>
      TeenHacksLI Shoutout: Organizer duo Laura and Lydia, running THLI 2025,
      are some of the craziest people I know because they‚Äôre determined to make
      an independently organized 24-hour hackathon happen again in a city where
      if you make it here, you can make it anywhere.
    </i>
    <p>
      And then I turned 18 years old. My happy birthday present was HoyaHacks.
      Like every newly minted adult, it came with a lot of mixed feelings. It
      was my first birthday away from home, but I was surrounded by the
      handcrafted gift of an empty, 70-degree Fahrenheit Washington, DC in
      January. I joked with Kevin during an event later that we manifested
      everything we wanted, but honestly, it might just be me, because I don‚Äôt
      think I‚Äôll ever get to be a tourist in DC on my birthday wearing a t-shirt
      ever again. Not everything was sweet that day, though. I ended up getting
      rejected by Georgia Tech and UVA on the same night. But, in the end, I got
      to build a fun project with a Python library I always wanted to try, and
      made a new friend. I didn‚Äôt get everything I wanted that night, but my
      choice to be at HoyaHacks instead of at home was a kismet consolation.
      Control what you can, and make choices that make you happy because the
      world won‚Äôt guarantee it for you.
    </p>
    <i
      >HoyaHacks Shoutout: Robert is just one of the first guys I met randomly,
      and we ended up being teammates. You‚Äôll hear of him again. This is hacker
      magic.
    </i>
    <p>
      Returning for a lighter weekend at home, I went to a single-day hackathon
      at the Beverly School in Manhattan, NYC. I built a little data dashboard
      using Streamlit to display my school's public finances. When Sahib and I,
      both working solo on separate projects, ended up winning, it was a welcome
      surprise. But even more meaningful was seeing Md‚Äôs little sister and her
      friend working on their project, along with meeting Rami and Baker. It‚Äôs a
      small world for hackers. Md was one of the mentors we found for
      TeenHacksLI, and Rami and Baker were friends with a hacker we had met at
      our first in-person hackathon. Community is hard to find, but when you
      build things, people come.
    </p>
    <i
      >BevHacks Shoutout: Rami and Baker are helping build HATM, Hack at the
      Museum, which is my final piece before starting my college chapter. They
      have a love for building things and learning that‚Äôs arguably stronger than
      mine. It‚Äôs something to envy.
    </i>
    <p>
      Full circle, I finally made it to San Francisco. My choice to start a club
      long before eventually brought me what I had missed in terms of Assemble.
      Thomas‚Äôs vision for making an event happen is a testimony to what hackers
      do on an organizational level. I‚Äôll be looking forward to seeing him again
      on the trail and seeing his magic take place again. I met a lot of
      familiar faces that weekend, along with a lot of friends I would continue
      to see. I ended up building a small web project using this obscure Lego
      library with Sarvesh, Sahib, and Lena. We would have done more if not for
      the 15-mile bike ride, but alas, maybe it‚Äôll be worth it when I am
      inspired to build something for a bicycle. A lot of incredible inspiration
      happened at this event, and a lot of wild things happened too. The
      infamous Waymo incident, if you know, you know.
    </p>
    <i>
      Summit Shoutout: Tolib, aka Junior, is a Hack Club leader I met at a DMV
      area hackathon. I forgot which one, but I ended up telling him about our
      club and the Hack Club community. Next thing you know, I see him in SF
      with us. As HCers and hackers, we should be open-minded enough to invite
      others into the fold. Most of them end up being incredible pieces of our
      story if you‚Äôre willing to make the first move.
    </i>
    <p>
      And then it was as if I went back in time with HackTCNJ. Their organizers
      had shifted the timeline up, making it less than a year since the last one
      had happened, but it was still oddly nostalgic. The local bus system was
      terrible last time we tried it, so we were dead set on an Uber, and when
      we looked out of the train station windows, it was snowing. The whole
      place was blanketed, and it actually looked like a nice place to be. For
      context, Trenton is not. The event didn‚Äôt live up to our past year‚Äôs
      expectations. The crowd just wasn‚Äôt the same, but we still built a fun
      project, which is hopefully relatable to all of you. Hackerman‚Äôs
      Challenge: an AI negotiation game where you talk with fellow organizers or
      participants at a hackathon over absolutely random conflicts, such as the
      lights being too bright. The experience reminded me to live in the moment
      because nothing is ever the same as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the final piece of the six exists Wonderland. It's a wonder that I even
      survived, but also it‚Äôs not. Because for all six hackathons, I had Sahib
      with me. It takes a real bro to go to all these events back-to-back with
      you. He ended up building the iconic Death Death Revolution at this event,
      and I built a really bad kite. I ended up reuniting with a lot of my
      Summit friends during this event, and I even gave Hack Club its first
      taste of poker. I had a lot of fun, and it was crazy how many of my
      friends were there. From my New Yorkers‚ÄîSahib, Baker, and Rami‚Äîto my
      Summit buddies: Sarvesh, Kevin, Lena; to my hackathon recruit, Robert and
      his sister; to those I met that day: Samay, Valerii, Micah, and more.
    </p>
    <i
      >Wonderland Shoutout: Kevin was one of the organizers of Wonderland, and I
      really got to see the genius of the event when he helped with the planning
      for HATM. He‚Äôs a real one in the hackathon space, and he‚Äôs one of the best
      hackers I‚Äôve met. Cheers!
    </i>
    <p>
      As much as I‚Äôd love to have done a seventh event (looking at you,
      Blueprint), I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt because by the event, I was coughing really
      hard. My pollen allergies had inflamed my throat to the point where I was
      popping DayQuils and ‚Äúvibing.‚Äù The chronic lack of sleep and exhaustion
      had taken their toll, but that experience of perseverance lives with me
      every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few hackathons between this and the end of this story and
      year: Apocalypse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It‚Äôs funny that I started with the Angels and ended with the Apocalypse. I
      went from building a game about grass to a Toronto Slang Zombie
      Translator. I suppose it‚Äôs a fitting end and an interesting place for the
      next chapter. To be honest with you, the time has passed quickly, and I
      never realized that it‚Äôs been a whole year because, in my mind, I‚Äôm the
      same person I was a year ago. But that‚Äôs not the case. How could I be?
      With friends across the globe, building things I never saw myself
      building, and traveling across the country, what didn‚Äôt change?
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, in my heart, I didn‚Äôt feel the same. There weren‚Äôt those
      nerves I had during AngelHacks. I was stoked to be flying to Canada, even
      if it was once again all alone. Because with Hack Club, I wasn‚Äôt.
